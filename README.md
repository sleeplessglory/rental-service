# Intro
This is a mobile and desktop application for rental service or its employees to use in their work. The app is written with 1C programming language. In order to launch the project you'll need to import both databases to 1C program and install it on your mobile device as well with the corresponding tools. This project also contains the Android folder with all the tools needed to install it on your mobile device but since github does not allow to upload massive size files, this folder was excluded from the final commit. Check out the corresponding ways to install 1C on your mobile device (version 8.3.19.59 is recommended). The client and standalone apk versions are also included to the project now.
